## Features

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture

Our Pokedex app leverages a CNN architecture for accurate and efficient image recognition of Pok√©mon. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of Pok√©mon images to ensure reliable predictions.

### Data Processing

The `data_processing.py` script handles the processing of raw Pok√©mon data, preparing it for training the CNN model. This includes data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation.

### Gradio Integration

Gradio is seamlessly integrated into the app to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Pokedex. Users can input images of Pok√©mon, and the app will predict and display details about the identified Pok√©mon.
